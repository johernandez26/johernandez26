### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on polishing the front-end of SecondChance, a platform for renting second-hand items to promote sustainability.
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning advanced React.js techniques and exploring Next.js for creating responsive, dynamic web applications.
ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects that combine software engineering and social impact, particularly in accessibility and community-building tools.
ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with integrating real-time features like WebSockets into front-end applications.
ðŸ’¬ Ask me about React.js, Django, accessibility in tech, or my journey as a first-generation Latino computer science student.
